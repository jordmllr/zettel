# Story 1 - Time Allocation
I can set up weekly time allocations which inform my interactions with Zettel.
I am given a blank week (168 hours). I assign a fixed amount to sleep every day (e.g. 8hrs * 7 days = 56 hours). I am shown how much time I have remaining (e.g. 168 - 56 = 112 hours). I can then assign a fixed amount to work (e.g. 40 hours). I am shown how much time I have remaining (e.g. 112 - 40 = 72 hours). I can repeat until all of my time is accounted for. 

I talk about my goals and interests with Zettel, and based on the available time, Zettel helps me decide how to allocate my remaining non-work, non-sleep time. 

Zettel helps me consider things like forgetting to allocate time for my relationships or hygeing or grocery shopping or fitness.

I can see what my forecasted productivity is under different scenarios. For example, if I write 200 words per day, 5 days per week, I will write 52,000 words per year. 

# Story 2 - Daily Retro
Every evening, I am prompted to do a retrospective. There are 3 phases:
1. what went well, what was accomplished?
2. what were bottlenecks to accomplishing my goals?
3. what adjustments do I want to make to remove bottlenecks?
I am prompted to work through each phase but I can also add things to any phase at any time. The phase in current focus is the default phase until it is marked complete.

# Story 3 - Pandaemonium onboarding
When I start Zettel, it has no idea what my thoughts or interests or background are. It knows nothing about me. In the Pandaemonium process, I write a stream of consciousness of all my goals and the directions I feel motivated to pursue. Instead of a long document, this is a series of fleeting notes that represent atomic impulses I feel. For example, I want to write a sci fi series called ceiling of stars that explores humanity, technology, and society in a post-apocalyptic near-future setting. Links should be noted or referenced. "I want to write a series in the ceiling of stars world about a woman named Lillet who starts off in an underwater city that has been quarantined for 100 years after losing contact with the surface world." 

When I feel like I have exhausted all my ideas, dreams, desires, obligations, and interests, I indicate that I have completed the Pandaemonium onboarding. Zettel then helps my organize the pandaemonium into an initial Zettel Tree. 

# Story 4 - Zettel Inbox
Throughout the day, I can add fleeting notes to Zettel. I can create a new note and it is automatically placed into the inbox and flagged for processing.

# Story 5 - Moving Notes from the Inbox to the Zettel Tree
Zettel marks inbox notes for processing and asks me questions to help atomatize and organize my notes into the Zettel Tree. For example, I may have an idea that a character in the first book of the Lillet series wants to return to the surface and restore the forges (automated manufacturing facilities at the heart of arcologies around the world). This will obviously go into the branch of the zettel tree that contains my Lillet notes. It probably would go under the branch for Cyrus, though it obviously will connect to certain plot points now. That's not the point. The point is that I can add this note to the inbox and Zettel will ask me questions to help me organize it into the tree. A

As new notes are added to the tree, the tree is automatically re-organized to reflect the new structure. For example, say this note contains a character not in the tree yet, we'll create a brief node about that character and connect this note as a child of that character.

For making software, a fleeting note may be an idea for a UI feature or color schema or algorithm or database architecture. The process is the same. Find the relevant branch and add the note as a child, ask questions about notes with semantic similarity and ask me if I want to make a connection to those notes.

# Story 6 - Making Tasks
One of the biggest bottlenecks I find with my own productivity is defining concrete incremental tasks. I am making Zettel because I want it to help me be incrementally and compoundingly productive. Zettel helps me define concrete incremental tasks. How? 

After the Pandaemonium Process, I will have a Zettel Tree that represents my goals and interests. I'll also have a lot of notes that are just thoughts. My first thought is that zettel should evaluate if a node is a context or information node or a project node. If it's a project node, it should either be determined to be the right size for a task or it should be broken down into tasks.

Example: I want to build a coffee table for my friend Maggie. This would go in the woodworking branch of the design and fabrication branch of the tree. Of course, making a coffee table is a big project. Zettel would help me identify the best next actions. To do this, I will add any additional context about the project and my goals. Then, Zettel will give me task suggestions and ask me which I think are the most important and then sequence them. For instance, with the coffee table, I need to settle on a design, select the wood, and determine the necessary tools to build it. After this first phase, It will be possible to make more tasks.
